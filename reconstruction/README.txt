To install h5flow and ndlar_flow, run the bash script `setup_h5flow_ndlar_flow.sh`.

Then activate the container with `source flow.venv/bin/activate`.

Run the light reconstruction with `run_flow_light_reco.sh`.
Optionally, can run charge hit builder with `run_flow_hitbuilder.sh`. Can easily modify to do more reconstruction stages.
